To turn in homework 3, create files (and subdirectories if needed) in
this directory, add and commit those files to your cloned repository,
and push your commit to your bare repository on GitHub.

Add any general notes or instructions for the TAs to this README file.
The TAs will read this file before evaluating your work.


Notes:
1. First of all, please run the server. And then type in the url frame "127.0.0.1:8000" or "127.0.0.1:8000", and then you can go to the login page. if you want to edit the url to go the home page or profile page, it is not available, you have to login. During login, you will get some errors meesage, if you meet some errors.

2. If you do not have user account, please sign up one. Click the button on the right top corner, you will go to sign up page.

3. In the sign up page, if you want to go back to the sign in page, you can click the sign in button on the right top corner.

4. In the sign up page, you can fill up the User Name, First Name, Last Name, Password and Password Confirmation to register a new user. During registration, you will get some errors information, if you make some mistakes.

5. When you register correctly, you will redirect to the profile page automatically. And you will see there is not message for the new user. 

6. In the profile page, you can post messages, for example, "I am happy today." And the message will show on you profile with time.

7. Also, in the top left, there is a button called "Home", which can redirect you to the home page, which can be also known as global stream. In this page, you can see all messages post by all users. 

8. In the home page, you can click the button on the top left corner "My profile" to go the current user's profile page, or click the specific link beside the posted messages to go to some specific users' profile page. 

9. Pay attention here, you can also post message in other users' profile page, but finally the message will post on you own profile page instead of others, I think that make sense. you can not change other's message posted history.

10. In the home page and profile page, in the top right corner, there is a button 'log out', which can help you to log out.

11. Both in home page and profile page, the messages will show in reverse-chronological order.
